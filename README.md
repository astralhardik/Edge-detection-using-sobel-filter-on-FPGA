# Edge-detection-using-sobel-filter-on-FPGA
To design and implement an image processing system on the Nexys 4 DDR FPGA that: - Loads image data from a memory initialized using a COE file generated in MATLAB, - Converts the RGB image to grayscale, - Applies a 3x3 Sobel filter for edge detection,- Displays the output on a VGA monitor.
